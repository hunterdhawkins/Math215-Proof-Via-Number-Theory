# Math215-Proof-Via-Number-Theory

A proof class taken at the University of Idaho during the summer 2020 semester. The classes goals were to introduce us into number theory and improve our proof writing skills. We also spent time using Latex to formalize out proofs. When reading these proofs please take into consideration that I am an applied mathematician rather than a pure mathematician, so proving mathematical formulas is not where most my studies are focused thus they may be lackluster to some.
